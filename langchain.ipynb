      "- 2 teaspoons ground cumin\n",
      "- 2 teaspoons paprika\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon garam masala\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon ground coriander\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon chili powder (adjust to taste)\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n",
      "- 1 onion, finely chopped\n",
